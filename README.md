# pizza-go: a Domino's SDK

This SDK was created purely for working with [cruster-api](https://github.com/rudoi/cruster-api). I will update these docs shortly.

A vast majority of this was inspired by [node-dominos-pizza-api](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-dominos-pizza-api). A huge thanks to everyone working on that! :tada:
